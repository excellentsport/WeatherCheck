Pythonista script to check the current weather in your location using your iPhone's latitude and longitude output. 

Attempts to get the current GPS data from your phone location, then queries the Dark Sky api for weather data in your location.

Needs a file named 'wc_config.py' in the same folder as the main script containing your default lat and long, and your DarkSky api key (you can get one for free from https://darksky.net/dev). Change the name of the 'wc_config_default.py' file, then add your info accordingly.
